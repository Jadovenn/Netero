This library expose containers and patterns working beside the STL.
I tried to make as much as possible features supported under Windows, linux based OS and macOs.

You'll find very basic algorithm container, patterns (like ecs, observer, ... ), math easing/function/primitive under steroids, an audio api and a very basic renderer.

You can access to the documentation by clicking on the "documented" badge.
Feel free to join the dedicated discord server to chat.

The library is in its very early stage.
