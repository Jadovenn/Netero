# Utility Library

This is an utility library containing different container and architecture that are frequently use for development of real-time software.
They are designed to be compatible and use beside the standard library.

# Motivation

I wrote this library because I am tired of rewriting all the time the same logic in my professional life and at school and I would like to improve my skills efficiently.
So this may help to be more oriented on "How I will implement this feature ?" instead of "How should I do this in C++ and is it the right way ?"

Many other library exist but combining them could be a real-pain, the idea is to use the standard library much as possible.
Add new container and abstraction while they are missing.
